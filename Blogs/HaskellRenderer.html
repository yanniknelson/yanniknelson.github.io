            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              In my first semester of University we had a course on functional
              programming where we learnt haskell. We were all challenged to
              write a haskell program that produced an image, with the added
              challenge of making it interactive. For this challenge I partnered
              with two friends to make a 3D version of Conway's Game of Life, my
              friends worked on the Game of Life code while I worked on the
              rendering code. I decided that I didn't want to use the in built
              3D renderer in OpenGL (GLUT) as I wanted to learn more about
              rendering algorithms. <br />
              <br />
              Note: The gif to the right (or above) is sped up to make it
              shorter, the real program runs slower.

            <h3>First steps</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The first stage of development was simply to try and get to grips
              with The graphics library. To do this I decided that I would write
              code that would take in a 2D Game of Life world and display that.
              I used this to learn how to shapes to the screen and learn about
              how openGL's callbacks and structure worked (display callback,
              reshape callback, keyboard and mouse callback, idle callback and
              the mainloop) along with OpenGL's buffers. I also started to learn
              about IORef from haskell, which honestly I still don't fully
              understand. <br />
              <br />
              All of this code can be found in the Rendering2D.hs file.

            <h3>To The Renderer</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The first stage of making the rendering engine was to take in a
              series of points that represented the centers of each alive cell,
              turn them into cubes and draw the corners onto the screen. <br />
              <br />
              This was the hardest part of the projects as I had never learnt
              about rendering before so I had to wrap my head around the maths.
              I also decided to make the cubes rotate to make it easier to for
              the eye to 'pick out' the cubes, this functionality was then used
              for keyboard controls to "move around the environment" (the
              quotation marks will make sense later).
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="paragraph right">
          <img src="/Images/faceRenderer.gif" alt="" class="first" />
          <div class="blogText">
            <p>
              The next stage was to draw the faces of the cubes, as I knew I
              would only be drawing cubes in this renderer I decided to simplify
              this job by drawing each face as a quad rather than two triangles
              as would be done with proper renderers. I was at this time aswell
              that I implemented movement control from the keyboard. The colours
              of the eacg cube was determined using its location. <br />
              <br />
              At this stage I was able to start taking in acutal Game of Life
              generations and displaying them. I implemented a timer into the
              idle callback to control progressing through the generations of
              the Game of Life.

            <h3>Issues</h3>
            <p class="with_header with_list_bellow">
              Once I did this I ran into a three main problems:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Cubes were being drawn over other cubes that were meant to be
                infront of them.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any Cubes were behind the camera, stange artifacting was
                occuring.
              </li>
              <li>The renderer ran very <em>VERY</em> slowly.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
              <li>
                My solution to the first problem was to order all of the
                (center) points by distance to the camera (which was locked to
                point (0,0,0)).
              </li>
              <li>
                My solution to the second problem was to lock the camera looking
                in the positive direction, move and rotate the environment
                instead of the camera and to discard any and all (center) points
                that would be behind the camera (this would aid in problem 3
                too).
              </li>
              <li>
                My further solution to the third problem was to throw the 3
                faces of all cubes that would never be seen by the camera.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="with_list_above">
              There was an alternative solution to the speed issue which
              invovled moving and rotating the camera instead of the
              environment. I implemented this camera's projection matrix and
              found the render's speed increased significantly. The issue with
              this method was the problem of removing cubes that were behind the
              camera became a lot more complex, and I would nobe able to solve
              it within the alloted time so sadly I had to abandon this
              solution.

            <h3>Final Thing</h3>
            <p>
              The final version was compiled with optimisation to further
              improve performance. If you're interested you can find this code
              on my github (We used my friend's github but I've forked it), It's
              precompiled for windows, but you can run and/or compile it
              yourself if you so desire (you will need to install the libraries,
              I do not have a guide for this). <br />
              <br />
              When you run it, you will see a blank screen, pressing '2' will
              open the 2D version and '3' the 3D version. The 3D version will
              look like it's not responding, give it a couple minutes the Game
              of Life generation code is very slow. Rotation controls use 'W',
              'A', 'S' and 'D' and movment controls use the arrow keys,
              generation change can be sped up and slowed down with '-' and '+'.
