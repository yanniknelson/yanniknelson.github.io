            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              During the summer of 2018 I decided I wanted a portable
              retro-games console for my last family holiday (the flight was
              long). I went searching for ideas for projects fitting this
              description online and stumbled across the Game Boy Zero project
              from
              <a href="https://www.sudomod.com/" target="_blank">sudomod</a>
              and decided to have a go at making my own. <br />
              <br />
              The Game Boy Zero I was building conisisted of a Raspberry Pi
              Zero, screen, Teensy (for controls) and a custom board for the
              buttons (not made by me). <br />
              <br />
              It was at this point that I added the battery and charging circuit
              (as you can see in the photo) doing so allowed the console to run
              without being plugged in. Unfortunately the charging functionality
              of the circuit wasn't working and while attempting to debug this
              issue the charging circuit blew the raspberry pi (at the very
              least). <br />
              <br />
              I hope to pick this project back up when I have both the time and
              the equipment, any progress will be documented here.
