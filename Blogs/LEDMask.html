            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              For the halloween of 2017 I decided I wanted to make my own
              costume myself and wanted an element of this costume to be
              technological.
              <a
                href="http://static2.cdn.ubi.com/ncsa/watchdogs/WRENCH_COSPLAY_GUIDE.pdf"
                target="_blank"

              >
              from the game Watch_Dogs 2 provided the perfect oportunity for
              this. Wrench's mask has LED matrices in the eyes that change in
              order to match his emotional state or current thoughts. This meant
              I had to have an led display in the eyes thin enough to allow me
              to still wear the mask, a board to control those leds and some way
              of triggering the change of the design displayed.<br />
              <br />
              Unfortunately I didn't manage to finish this project in time for
              said halloween and it was left untouched until halloween 2018 when
              I decided to finish it.

            <h3>The Tech</h3>
            <p class="with_header with_list_bellow">
              The parts used in the mask were:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>4 8x16 LED matrices with driver boards</li>
              <li>1 Adafruit Bluefruit LE Feather Board</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="with_list_above">
              The LED matricies were paired up and superglued together to create
              two 16x16 matrices, one for each eye. The deiver boards
              communicated with the feather using I2C, and each had 3 solderable
              pads that indicated their address (allowing for 8 total), these
              were soldered to address the matrices 0-3. This allowed me to
              create a makshift buss that all the matrices connected too, but
              would only listen to if I so desired. Finally all of the matrices
              were powered in parallel from the 5V pin on the featherboard.

            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <p class="with_header with_list_bellow">
              The majority of the written code consists of variables storing the
              binary 'images' that are to be displayed. <br />
              <br />
              The majority of the functional code consists of setup for the LED
              matrices and the LE bluetooth connections (almost all of which are
              dealt with using adafruit libraries). <br />
              <br />
              The control code simply plays an animation, starts the random
              emote timer and functionality and starts listens over bluetooth
              for a 'command' which matches an action that can be taken:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a number less than 1000 or equal to, then match the input to
                an emote.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a number greater than 1000, then set emote change time to
                said number (in milliseconds).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="with_list_above">
              The code can be found on my github for any interseted parties.

            <h3>Mask V1</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              I decided to use skiing goggles and perforated sheet metal
              (aluminium for ease of cutting) to house the LEDs. I removed the
              lens from the goggles and covered it with masking tape, I then
              peeled of the masking tape and stuck that flat on the sheet metal,
              and traced around it to get the shape I needed. I cut the metal
              with tin snips, bent it into shape and spray painted it black. I
              could then simply pop it into the goggles as a replacement
              'lense'.<br />
              <br />
              As you can probably see from the images from the last paragraph
              and this one, initially the LED matrices were set up to display
              with the power and data wires coming out of the right of the
              display. This posed many issues with fitting the displays inside
              the goggles I had bought to house them as the wires of the left
              display would get in the way of the right one and the wires of the
              right display would stick out the side of the goggles. This along
              with weak soldering connections and the lower half of the mask not
              arriving in the post caused the desired deadline to pass by
              without having completed the mask. <br />
              <br />
              The project then went untouched until october 2018 when I decided
              to pick it up and finish the project.

            <h3>Mask V2</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              For the final version, I decided to buy a motorcycle mask to house
              the electronics, I did this as they come with a guard for the rest
              of the face included and the mask if found had larger goggles
              making fitting the matrices easier. The same procedure for the
              goggles was carried out for the new mask with the peforated metal.
              <br />
              <br />
              The displays were rotated to have the wires at the bottom, making
              fitting them in the mask easier, the feather was hot glued to one
              of the cheeks of the mask and foam was hot glued onto the back fo
              the displays for comfort. I also re-solderd some components to
              make it more secure and more reliable.

              This is the first time I got to see the mask on and working. In
              the video the mask isn't running the final version of the code,
              but most changes after this point were small.

              This is the final costume, all of the costume parts were made by
              me, including the shoes, the braclet and the jacket, to which i
              had to individually attach studs and sew on patches.
