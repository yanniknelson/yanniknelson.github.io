            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              When I become interested in a topic I often go majorly overboard
              with my enthusiasm and background knowledge in an attempt to be as
              good at it as I possibly can, this is what happened with
              programming and this project. I had the thought that maybe if I
              understood more about how the actual bare metal of a computer
              worked I'd be able to write better code, as it turns out this
              holds some truth, but not as much as I'd hoped.<br />
              <br />
              This started with taking the
              <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a> course
              online and working throught it all, but at the end of it I decided
              I wanted more practical experience with computer architecture,
              that's where this project and
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc">Ben Eater</a> came
              in. Ben Eater is the youtuber who designed this CPU and produced a
              series of videos explaining the logic (which I already understood
              thanks to nand2tetris) and the electrical sides to the CPU (which
              I was sorely lacking knowledge of). And so I decided to follow
              along, as I watched I made a list of all the parts needed for each
              'module' and took notes of how it all worked making circuit
              diagrams where necessary and sourced and bought all of the chips
              etc... . It turned out a couple months after I'd finished the
              project Ben Eater started selling kits with all the parts needed
              to make this, oh well.

            <h3>Clock</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The clock Consists of 2 modes, an auto run mode whose frequency
              can be changed using a potentiometer and a step mode where each
              clock cycle is a press of a button. You can switch between these
              two modes using a toggle switch, as a note both the button and
              toggle switch are de-bounced using 555-timers to avoid accidental
              cycles beign performed. The chosen clock signal then goes through
              an edge detector before being sent to the other modules. The clock
              lines are shown using white wire.

            <h3>Instruction Cycles</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The instuctions for this CPU use a maximum of 6 clock cycles, this
              is achieved using a 4-bit counter that indicated which stage of an
              instruction the CPU is currently executing and is incremented
              every (inverted) clock cycle (shown by the blue LED). We pass the
              first three bits (shown by the red LEDS) to the decode ROM and to
              a demultiplexer which defaults high and has the input pulled low
              so that all except the selected output will be high (shown by the
              green LEDS) and the 7th output is connected to the rest of the
              counter so that once the final instruction cycle is used the
              counter is reset.

            <h3>Instruction Register</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The instuction register pulls its value from the bus and can be
              broken down into two parts, the instruction bits (shown with blue
              LEDS) and the address bits (shown with yellow LEDS). The 4
              instruction bits determine which instruction is to be executed,
              resulting in there being a maximum of 16 different instructons,
              and the 4 address bits can be ouput back onto the bus by
              instructions that require this, for exmple for loading a literal
              into the A register or for accessing memory.

            <h3>Control Lines</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The value of the instruction bits + the three bits from the
              counter are then used as addresses in the decode ROM which will
              then output the desired control lines. The control lines are shown
              using yellow wires and the values of the lines are displayed using
              a series blue LEDS.<br />
              <br />
              Note: Some of the actual values required for the control lines are
              inverted, these are not shown in the series of blue LEDS, instead
              if a line is active the line from the decode ROM is set to high
              and th put through its corresponding LED and then put through an
              inverter before going to its corresponding module.

          <div class="blogText">
            <h3>Memory Modes</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The RAM for this Computer is included as it's own module as well
              with two modes, Programming Mode(red LED) and Execution Mode(Green
              LED), which can be selected using a toggle switch.<br />
              <br />
              Execution Mode works excatly as you'd expect, the memory address
              (shown by the yellow LEDs) is determined by a 4-bit register that
              is set either by the program counter or a literal from an
              instruction and the value at that address (shown by the red LEDs)
              is out put when the memory output control line is active.<br />
              <br />
              Programming Mode causes the address to be determined by a
              4-position DIP switch allowing the programmer to access memory by
              hand. Then an 8-position DIP switch is used to determine the
              desired value at a memory address and that value is written with
              the push of a button (not automatically), note that writing memory
              using this button is disabled in Execution Mode.

            <h3>ALU</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The ALU has two registers an A register (on top) and B register
              (bellow) and always automatically sums them but only outputs to
              the result to the bus when the ALU output control line is active.
              <br />
              <br />
              The ALU also has 'extra' arichecture for zero and carry bits. The
              zero bit is found by nanding the bits of the alu output in pairs
              and then anding those results until a single bit is produced. This
              can be seen at the bottom right of the module and the blue LED
              there shows the result of that process. The carry flag is simply
              the top carry from the adder circuit and is shown by the blue LED
              just bellow the A regsiter LED display. These are then connected
              to extra circuitry used to determin wheter a conditional jump will
              occur (the green LEDS, left is the carry bit, right is the zero
              bit).

            <h3>Display</h3>
            <p class="with_header">
              The display always automatically displays whatever is in its
              register. Multiplexing is used to display values greater than 1
              digit, this required the display to have its own clock.<br />
              <br />
              To determine which display was to be used for each 'display-clock'
              cycle a similar method to the instruction cycles was used, except
              with a two bit coutner. The output from the multiplexer connected
              to the enable pins for each of the displays so for that each
              'display-clock' cycle only one of the 7-segment displays is on.<br />
              <br />
              A decode ROM is then used to determine which of the pins for the
              7-segment display should be active in order to 'draw' a number.
              This ROM used the value in the display register along with the
              value of the 2-bit counter as addresses. An extra address bit was
              available after this which was used as a 2's complement bit as
              seen to the left.

            <p>
              The first program ever run on this computer was necessarily
              'output 42' because I'm a massive Hitch Hicker's Guide fan (in
              actuality it was add two values to get 42 and then output, but the
              effect was the same).

              The only other program really worth running on this computer is
              one that generates the fibbonaci sequence (or at least as much as
              is representable with 8 bits). This required almost all of the RAM
              and is thus pretty much the most complicated program this computer
              is capable on running.
