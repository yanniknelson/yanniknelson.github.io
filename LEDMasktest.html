              For the halloween of 2017 I decided I wanted to make my own
              costume myself and wanted an element of this costume to be
              technological.

              from the game Watch_Dogs 2 provided the perfect oportunity for
              this. Wrench's mask has LED matrices in the eyes that change in
              order to match his emotional state or current thoughts. This meant
              I had to have an led display in the eyes thin enough to allow me
              to still wear the mask, a board to control those leds and some way
              of triggering the change of the design displayed.<br />

              During the summer of 2018 I decided I wanted a portable
              retro-games console for my last family holiday (the flight was
              long). I went searching for ideas for projects fitting this
              description online and stumbled across the Game Boy Zero project
              from
              <a href="https://www.sudomod.com/" target="_blank">sudomod</a>
              and decided to have a go at making my own. <br />
              <br />
              The Game Boy Zero I was building conisisted of a Raspberry Pi
              Zero, screen, Teensy (for controls) and a custom board for the
              buttons (not made by me). <br />
              <br />
              It was at this point that I added the battery and charging circuit
              (as you can see in the photo) doing so allowed the console to run
              without being plugged in. Unfortunately the charging functionality
              of the circuit wasn't working and while attempting to debug this
              issue the charging circuit blew the raspberry pi (at the very
              least). <br />
              <br />
              I hope to pick this project back up when I have both the time and
              the equipment, any progress will be documented here.
